# Introduction #

This project aims provide to Linux users, control a Lego NXT Robot by means of a PC Remote Control using bluetooth device.  Other applications with similar profiles, may be found, but none of theme work fully.  While some only run over Windows, other ones run over Linux without bluetooth functionality.

# Main features #

## Minimalist ##

Its user interface is very simple, preserving the essential one.  User may play with his NXT Robot in three natural steps:
  1. Run nxt-pc-remote-control app
  1. Scan devices
  1. Connect device

## Rapidity and Precision ##

Commonly, the NXT Robots require two velocities kind: A fast speed to displacements and other slow speed to tune movements.  NXT PC Remote Control utilize the Alt-Key to switch of fast speed to low speed in one touch.

These velocities may be tuned separately.
